# Weekly report 5

## 11.2
1. Added a toggle (CheckBox) to allow hiding of drawing layers.
1. Trying to debug the big crashing bug on JPS, but can't figure it out.
1. Added missing heuristics to JPS which fixed the hanging issue.

## 12.2
1. Worked on implementation of my collections.
1. MyPriorityQueue added. All Pathfinders use it now.

## 13.2
1. Started working on MyArrayList.
1. It is buggy at the moment and breaks the project so not pushing it to master just yet.

## 14.2
1. Peer review: https://github.com/StarSovu/tiralabra-kivipaperisakset/issues/1
1. Fixed MyArrayList. I think the project is done code-wise.
1. Moving onto code and test improvements. Got some good feedback from the peer review and from a colleague.
