# Weekly report 3

## 26.1
1. As an early graphical interface is in place, moving to work on A*.
1. I think I got A* down as well, need to test it.
1. Nope, not returning as short path as Dijkstra. Need create some unit tests.

## 27.1
1. A* fixed, heuristic bad. Need to improve heuristic as it is currently as efficient as Dijkstra's.
1. Learned that I cannot improve it much without losing on optimal path. Moving to Jump-Point Search (JPS).

## 28.1 - 30.1
1. Just pushed progress so far.

## 31.1
1. Added missing project files.
1. Reading about JPS. Looks like I will modify the maps to be of uniform.
1. Started implementing JPS.
